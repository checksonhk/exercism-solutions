  IDEA from Glenn Espinosa:
  - Start from desired edge, with desired color
    (eg, from top w/ O, or from left w/ X).
  - See where you can go from there (matching), that we haven't been.
  - For each such place
    * recurse with the current spot added to list of where we've been
  - If we hit opposite side, that color has won
  - If we can't go anywhere, end this exploration;
    automagically goes back to last fork-point
