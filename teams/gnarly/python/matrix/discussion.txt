What to Test:

- Test that it gives correct results (row and col) for a simple
  matrix; 3x3 should do fine, testing all rows and cols, so we cover
  first, last, and another.

- Test row and column extraction with minimal sizes: 1xN, Nx1, and
  1x1.

- Test row and column extraction with some other rectangular but not
  square matrix, like 3x2 or 4x3 or whatever.

- Test row and column extraction with mixed-width numbers, i.e., some
  single-digit, some double or more, to make sure we're not just using
  textual column numbers.

- Test row and column extraction with negatives, floats, and negative
  floats.

- Test row and column extraction with an invalid index (zero or less).
  IMHO, it should return an empty list.  None is OK too.

- Test row and column extraction with an empty matrix.  I'm thinking,
  that means any index is invalid, so again, return empty list or
  None, whichever we decided on above.

- IMHO we can skip testing what it does if the matrix is not
  rectangular, or matrix elements are not numbers (string).


What I Learned:

- splitlines()
