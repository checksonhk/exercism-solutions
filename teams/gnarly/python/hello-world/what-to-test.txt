It takes no arguments, reads nothing from elsewhere, and has no side
effects, not even i/o.  So, all we _can_ test, is what it returns,
when called with no args.

By contrast, something that at least took an arg and did something
with it, or did something with something read from elsewhere, might
need further tests to confirm proper behavior with different arguments
or other input.  Likewise, something that has a side effect would need
a test to check *that*.
