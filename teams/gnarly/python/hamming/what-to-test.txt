NORMAL TESTS:
Two identical one-base strands have distance 0
Two different one-base strands have distance 1
There's probably not much value in testing two-base strands
Two identical three-base strands have distance 0
Two three-base strands differing at one place (3 ways) have distance 1
Two three-base strands differing at two places (3 ways) have distance 2
Two three-base strands differing at all bases have distance 3
(This should be enough to imply correct behavior with longer strands)


LIGHT BULLETPROOFING -- basic valid edge cases
Two empty strands have distance 0


MEDIUM BULLETPROOFING -- invalid edge cases, reasonable errors
Raises/returns error if strands are not same length
Raises/returns error if either strand contains an invalid base


HEAVY BULLETPROOFING -- deliberately bad input, infrastructure failure, etc.
Raises/returns error if either strand is not the expected data type (string?)
